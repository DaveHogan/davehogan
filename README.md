## Hello, I'm Dave 👋

### 👨🏻‍💻 About Me
While my contributions to the Open Source community are modest, I'm eager to change that.

I've developed software professionally since 2002, starting as a modern apprentice at a local authority. But my passion for programming goes back even further. My journey began when my Nan introduced me to an Amstrad CPC 464, where I learned to write my name and address. From that moment, I was hooked! Later, I got my hands on an Amiga and discovered Amos and Blitz Basic - sparking a lifelong love for coding. Drawing and moving a box on a screen was magic! But that's enough nostalgia for now.

### 🛠️ Interests and Experience
I have far too many hobbies, including `Programming`, `Blockchain`, `Gym`, `3D Printing`, and `Music Theory`. I also attempt to play the `Piano` and `Guitar`.

#### Current Experience
I primarily work with the Microsoft stack, including `C#`, `MAUI`, `Razor`, `Blazor`, `Azure`, `MS SQL Server`, and `Azure DevOps (CI/CD)` full-time in the corporate world. I have several personal projects to keep me up-to-date and explore tech I don't get to explore in the day-to-day work, with [Gym Directory UK](https://gymdirectory.co.uk)  being the most recent.

#### Limited Past Experience
I've also had some experience with `PHP`, `F#`, `TeamCity`, and `MySQL`.
